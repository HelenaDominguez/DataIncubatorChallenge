##Analysis of the most significant factors affecting education results

Education is one of the fundamental pillars of the development of a country. Having well educated children is a guarantee for technological and economic progress in the next decades. However, we know there are many factors that may affect students performance. Detecting the causes behind academic failure is the best way to tackle them form their origin to have an equal opportunity society.

I propose to take advantage of the numerous data and statistics available in the US Department of Education webpage to gain some insight of variables influencing education results. These data include State Assessments results, teachers/administrators characteristics, demographics, student outcomes and graduation rates for a great number of schools and high schools and many other aspects which can be of great help in this kind of study.

In the supporting plots I produced for the challenge, I analyzed data with information about the Achievement Results for State Assessments of 16162 high schools at LEA in 2014/2015 year, both for the Mathematics and Reading/Language Arts Assessments, including 229 variables (locations, races, economical disadvantages, etc.). After some exploratory work with the data set, very clear trends were detected: student achievements are related to factors such as race, limited English proficiency or disadvantage economical situations (see attached plots). However, we know that association does not mean causation. Identifying the root reasons for academic failure or success is the best way to offer our children better opportunities while making the national business more competitive in the medium-term.
